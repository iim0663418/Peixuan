# ArcGIS World GeocodeServer API License Summary

### Free Tier & Pricing
*   **Free Tier:**
    *   20,000 geocodes (not stored) per month.
    *   20,000 reverse geocodes (not stored) per month.
    *   Search suggestions are free.
*   **Pay-As-You-Go (Cloud):**
    *   $0.50 per 1,000 geocodes (not stored).
    *   $4.00 per 1,000 stored geocodes (requires active subscription).
*   **On-Premises (ArcGIS World Geocoder):**
    *   Fixed annual subscription with tiered limits (e.g., Basic tier = 250 million geocodes/year).

### Usage Restrictions
*   **Storage:** Storing geocoding results permanently is generally **prohibited** unless you have a specific paid subscription that authorizes it (costs significantly more). "Not stored" results must be used for immediate display or calculation and then discarded.
*   **On-Premises Restriction:** The on-premises World Geocoder is for **internal use only**. You cannot use it to provide a public-facing geocoding service or power a commercial app for external customers.
*   **Attribution:** You must display Esri and data provider attribution on any map or app using the service.
*   **Batch Limits:** Technical limits exist, such as a maximum batch size (e.g., 2,000 addresses per request) for the cloud service.

### Commercial Use
*   **Cloud Service:** Commercial use is permitted under the pay-per-use model (ArcGIS Platform / Location Platform), provided you adhere to terms regarding storage and attribution.
*   **Value-Added Apps:** You can build commercial apps if end-users bring their own ArcGIS licenses, or if you use the appropriate Developer Subscription to generate API keys.
*   **Internal Only:** As noted, the on-premises solution is strictly for internal organizational use, not for building commercial SaaS products for others.
