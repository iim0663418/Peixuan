## Active Context

- Last Verified: Website UX Evaluation and Major Redesign Planning
- Next: Ready for Phase 1 implementation

## Summary
Completed comprehensive website UX evaluation and created major redesign strategy:

### Analysis Results
- Evaluated entire website against 5 design principles
- Identified key UX issues: coordinate intimidation, developer tab exposure, information overload
- Confirmed target audience: General public (90%) + hidden professional features (10%)

### Redesign Strategy
- Philosophy: Transform from "Tool" to "Companion" ("The Oracle, Not The Spreadsheet")
- Approach: Radical simplification with AI-first narrative
- Implementation: 3 phases over 5-7 days

### Key Decisions
- Developer tab: Ctrl+Shift+D trigger (hidden but accessible)
- Geocoding failures: City selection list fallback
- Timeline: Phase 1 (2-3 days) → Phase 2 (2-3 days) → Phase 3 (1-2 days)

### Ready for Implementation
- Phase 1: Core simplification (hide coordinates, remove dev tab UI, reorder results)
- All specifications documented and committed as baseline
