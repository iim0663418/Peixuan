Feature: Phase 3 Advanced Visual Enhancements for Premium User Experience
  As a user seeking the most immersive analysis experience
  I want sophisticated visual interactions and polished details
  So that the platform feels premium and engaging at every touchpoint

  Background:
    Given Phase 1 and Phase 2 visual enhancements are active
    And the gradient rendering system is fully operational
    And the atmospheric background effects are running
    And the design token system is loaded

  Scenario: Deep Interactive Effects
    Given the user is viewing AI analysis content
    When the user interacts with different content elements
    Then table rows should have smooth hover animations with subtle scaling
    And cards should have gentle flip effects on interaction
    And scroll-based parallax effects should create depth perception
    And all interactions should feel responsive and premium
    And effects should respect user motion preferences

  Scenario: Advanced Animation System
    Given new content is being loaded or displayed
    When content appears on screen
    Then content blocks should fade in with staggered timing
    And sections should load progressively with smooth transitions
    And scroll-triggered animations should activate at appropriate thresholds
    And animations should use Intersection Observer for performance
    And all animations should be GPU-accelerated where possible

  Scenario: Visual Detail Polish
    Given the user is viewing the analysis interface
    When examining visual elements closely
    Then shadows should have multiple layers for realistic depth
    And interactive elements should have subtle glow effects on focus
    And text should have enhanced shadows for better readability
    And borders should have gradient treatments where appropriate
    And the overall visual hierarchy should feel cohesive and premium
